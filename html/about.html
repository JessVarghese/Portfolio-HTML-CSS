          <h3>Digital Media Professional | Front End Developer</h3>
          <article>
            <p>Over the last decade I’ve gained extensive experience within the digital media landscapes.</p>

            <p>In my most recent role as an Account Executive for a physician healthcare marketing company, I managed
              the
              company’s portfolio of top hospital, medical device, and medical education clients and served as a key
              advisor
              in the implementation of their digital publishing platform and video content marketing strategy. In
              addition, I
              directed a cross functional team comprised of employees within our production, marketing, design, and
              development departments. Prior to my promotion to Account Executive, I managed all stages of production,
              produced live surgical webcasts to clinical round table discussions, and played a key role in editing web
              and
              video content for client websites as a senior video producer.</p>

            <p>I recently earned a certificate in full-stack web development from the UConn Coding Bootcamp where I
              developed
              skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, Node.JS, and responsive web design. As an innovative problem
              solver
              passionate about developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development, I am currently
              looking
              for opportunities to combine my experience with my new skills in full stack development.</p>

            <p>Outside of work and learning about web development, I enjoy spending time with family, my dog Herbie,
              traveling,
              cooking, reading non-fiction books, and going to live concerts.</p>
