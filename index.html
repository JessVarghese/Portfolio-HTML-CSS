                    <p><span>Hi, I’m Jess. Welcome to my portfolio page! Over the last decade I’ve worked within the digital media landscapes. In my most recent role as an Account Executive for a physician healthcare marketing company, I managed  the company’s portfolio of top hospital, medical device, and medical education clients and served as a key advisor in the implementation of their digital publishing platform and video content marketing strategy.  In addition, I directed a cross functional team comprised of employees within our production, marketing, design, and development departments.  Prior to my promotion to Account Executive, I managed all stages of production, produced live surgical webcasts to clinical round table discussions, and played a key role in editing web and video content for client websites as a senior video producer.
                        I am currently look for opportunities to combine my experience with my new skills in full-stack development.</span></p>
