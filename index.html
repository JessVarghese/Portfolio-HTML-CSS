    <h2>Hi, I’m Jess.</h2>
    <article>Over the last decade I’ve worked within the digital media landscapes. In my most recent role as an Account
      Executive for a physician healthcare marketing company, I managed the company’s portfolio of top hospital, medical
      device, and medical education clients and served as a key advisor in the implementation of their digital
      publishing platform and video content marketing strategy. In addition, I directed a cross functional team
      comprised of employees within our production, marketing, design, and development departments. Prior to my
      promotion to Account Executive, I managed all stages of production, produced live surgical webcasts to clinical
      round table discussions, and played a key role in editing web and video content for client websites as a senior
      video producer.<br>I am currently look for opportunities to combine my experience with my new skills in full-stack
      development.</article>
